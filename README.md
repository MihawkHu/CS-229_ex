#CS-229_ex
Here are exercises of Machine Learning course(CS_229) in coursera.

I have just finished this course on Coursera. To be honest, it's the best course I have ever taken in Coursera. The professor is very intresting and the context of this course taught me a lot. 

It's only a begun for me to my machine learning way.
